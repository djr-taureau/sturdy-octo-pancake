# Things I Have Learned at Bloc.io


1. So far most of the material in the course has been a very nice refresher course in HTML and CSS but I have learned many new things about HTML 5 that I did not know before. 
2. I was introduced to some nice dev resources including: 
     - devdocs.io
     - codepen.com
     - codewars.com
     - JSBin.com
3. I have learned about some of the new features of HTML 5. I would say one of the biggest standouts in HTML 5 is the built in functinality in forms which used to require a lot of javascript to create:
     - date pickers
     - required fields
     - field focus
     - the input-range field gives you a nice little slider
4. Also there are some new form fields which provide better usabilty on mobile devices. These fields leverage the functionality on the devices. These include:
      - the input-date field
      - the input-tel field
      - the input-number field
5. HTML5 provides more structural and semantic elements. Presumably these have been introduced to address the fact that as Internet technology evolves we are seeing more and more content consumed by machines. Prior to this we had to create our own structure using DIVS and classes.
